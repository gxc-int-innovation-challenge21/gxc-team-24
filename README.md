# Introduction

In this course we were allowed to develop a prototype for the European Championships Munich 2022 that inspires people to lead a more active lifestyle, encourages visitors and spectators to visit the event themselves and ultimately promotes sustainability by motivating people to join local sports clubs. All this is to be realized through a digital solution. 

In this wiki you can get an idea of the solution we propose for this task and how we achieved it.

# Problem Statement

How can the European Championships Munich 2022 motivate their visitors and spectators to do more sports and inspire them to lead more active lifestyles, creating a positive impact for local sport clubs and society as a whole?

# Empathy Map

### Who?

We decided to focus on people currently involved in sports, people interested in getting involved, and people who want motivation to do sports. Overall, we determined that this was a large sector of society and an important audience in the time of the pandemic. One assumption that we made was that a large portion of these people will either be tuning in to watch the European Championships in Munich 2022 or will visit in person. 

### What do they need to DO?

This part was a bit more challenging. We decided that our audience generally wants to cultivate an interest in sports as either a passive observer or an active participant. The success of this goal will be determined by rising memberships in local sports groups, greater participation in sporting events, and positive reports from the Ministry of Health. 

### How do they learn about lifestyle motivation and the event?

Combining a few of the sections of the empathy map, we determined that most of our target audience learns about different ways to improve their active lifestyles through social media, from friends and family, and through interaction with sporting events. We also predicted that most people learn about the European Championships Munich 2022 through social media, the workplace, friends, and family. Determining how people view both the event and the problem that we have identified will be very helpful when we start brainstorming ideas for a challenge solution. We can tailor our solution to address all the ways that people find information about lifestyles motivation and sporting events like the European Championships. 

### How do they feel?

Arguably the most important part of the empathy map, we also tried to predict the "pains" and "gains" that people in our target audience might have. Some of the common fears and related goals were social interaction, finding time to exercise, connecting with people, and even how to find sports groups in a pandemic. By identifying some of the motivations of our target audience before brainstorming, we are able to take a more human-focused path to developing an impactful solution. 

## Conclusion

After working through the empathy map and the problem statement builder, we as a team feel more comfortable to tackle the next part of the innovation process. In particular, it was very helpful to identify and profile our target audience BEFORE brainstorming instead of leaving that as secondary to the idea itself.

# The Business Model Canvas

**Objective:** Prove that our solution can be a viable business

**Positioning:** A startup team creating a business around our idea

The purpose of the business model is to create a story of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value. It can be used as a tool to prove business viability of a startup, the next step in making an idea a reality.

The canvas is divided into 9 parts: Partners, Activities, Resources, Cost Structure, Customer Relations, Customer Segments, Channels, Revenue Streams, and most importantly, Value Propositions. 

### Value Proposition
The last item, the Value Propositions, is the key selling point for a business, the main argument as to why a business or startup should be supported. Our team decided to focus on three aspects of our prototype value: the services offered, the benefits for customers, and the proposition. 

Our prototype offers several **services** as a connecting app: a match service to find others with similar sports interests, a feed page that allows users to see upcoming and ongoing events and games and to catch up with what their friends are doing, a list of sports clubs with an accessibility rating for users with disabilities to find accommodations, and an event and facility map with the option to book times for games or reservations at an event like the European Championships Munich 2022. 

From these services, we hope that users **benefit** in these ways: they connect with other users interested in similar sports to form stronger motivations to lead a more healthy lifestyle, they have the chance to meet other attendees at the European Championships Munich 2022 to watch the sporting events together, and they find local sports groups that fit their lifestyle. 

In summary, our group came up with this statement as our **Value Proposition**: The value of our organization is to help users form meaningful connections with other people to lead more active lifestyles and attend local sports clubs and events like the European Championships. 

### Partners and Resources

To get off the ground and keep the business running, we need a few key things as a startup. First, we have **partners** that we work with on a regular basis. In particular, we chose to focus on partnering with local sports groups and facilities, as well as local events, especially the European Championships. To further strengthen our prototype, we wanted to partner with a marketing agency and some professional athletes to strengthen our app customer base. 

In conjunction with our partners, our business will also require a few **activities**. In the production phase, we need backend development and UI design on the technical side, but we also need to get our partners aboard the program to get off the ground. As we grow as a business, we will have some platform requirements in the form of customer participation to build our database as most of our functions are dependent on customer participation. We will also need many partnerships with local sports clubs and facilities to provide our booking and map functions and partnerships with local events like the European Championships to improve customer participation. As our final activity, we will constantly need to be on the lookout for new partners to generate revenue with in order to continue growing. 

Finally, there are a few **key resources** that we will need to get off the ground and maintain our app. First off, we will need servers and customer service agents to keep the actual app running, which after some larger initial costs will become a regular overhead resource. We will also require access to customers Paypal/credit information to complete online payments in addition to their smartphone platforms to run the app. Most importantly, we require participation from customers and local sports groups to keep our business running, as it is a community-based prototype. Without participation from customers and local sports groups, we would be missing several of our key services like the feed function, the match function, and the facility booking page. 

### Cost and Revenue

Overall, we shouldn't have too many costs and therefore won't have many revenue streams. Our fixed **costs** include maintenance of the app and customer service as well as a physical office with about 8-10 employees including maintenance employees, customer service agents, and connective agents who work specifically to build our partnerships with local clubs, facilities and events. These employees will get a base fixed rate but will also get bonuses for bringing in new partnerships with events, clubs, and facilities. Our variable costs are mostly limited to the travel expenses for our connective agents although we did include the bonuses that they could receive. Using an online resource called estimatemyapp.com, we determined a beginning budget of 28.000 Euro per year, which is likely to change as the business grows since that estimate is dependent mostly on the technical requirements. 

On the other side of the coin, we have our **revenue streams**. Most of our revenue will come from brokerage fees, as we want to be a largely non-profit app. This includes a commission from event ticket sales that we encourage customers to go to, a percentage of facility booking fees when booked through our app, revenue from events using our app as a service (such as the European Championships), and even licensing fees on some our functions. We also plan to utilize advertisements on the app as a revenue stream. Our payment methods will be largely online and through the app, which currently does not have the ability to process online payments, so that will need to be adjusted when we move to that structure. 

### Customer Relationships and Segments

We have a wide variety of customers in our main audience, from people who recently moved to a new place to people just looking to meet new people or start new sports and even local companies, schools, or groups that want team building activities. It is our job to connect them to groups like the European Championships, local sports clubs, event organizers, and sports facilities. 

To reach all of our **segments**, we need to establish and **maintain relationship**s with our customers. Most importantly, we are a self service that fits the customer with people and groups with similar interests and needs, so a lot of our relationship with customers will be automated, although we will need a foundational customer service and email support team. To start off our business, we will need the customer support base and a basic customer base to fulfill our services so it is important to start marketing early through advertisements to build up our user base, especially since our main way of collecting new users is through advertisements. 

To reach our customer segments, we need to integrate many of the distribution **channels**. In particular, the Apple Store and Google Play would be the best way to connect with customers directly. To accomplish integrating these channels, we need to make sure that we are aware of the requirements from these platforms. Outside of application stores, we also need to build a website and a social media presence to reach more customers and provide a way for them to contact us and form stronger relationships. In particular, we need a charismatic social media presence that will keep people engaged with our business.
